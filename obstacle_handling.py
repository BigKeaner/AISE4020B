Detects and classifies obstacles, handling path adjustments.
```python
def detect_obstacle():
    """Scans for obstacles and returns their classification (temporary/permanent)."""
    pass  # Implement obstacle detection

def classify_obstacle():
    """Determines if an obstacle is temporary or permanent."""
    pass  # Implement classification logic

def recalculate_path():
    """Finds a new shortest path if a permanent obstacle is detected."""
    pass  # Implement path recalculation
```
