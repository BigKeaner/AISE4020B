Handles QR code scanning and image recognition for determining position.
```python
import cv2

    """Scans for a QR code and returns its data if found."""
    pass  # Implement QR code detection using OpenCV

def use_image_recognition():
    """Uses image recognition to estimate position if no QR code is found."""
    pass  # Implement image-based localization
